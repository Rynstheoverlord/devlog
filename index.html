    <h3>My top 5 languages</h3>
    <i>updated 4th March 2023</i>
    <br><br>
    <p><b>5. JavaScript:</b> JavaScript only got into the list recently because before now i had utterly loathed and 
    disliked the language, but as time progressed, i realized that JavaScript contained a little beauty within it.
</p>

    <p><b>4. Golang:</b> Golang, usually refered to as <b>Go</b> is an outstanding language developed by Google,
    Athough i havent really written much in golang, i've begun to develop a love for it placing it in my top 4</p>

    <p><b>3. C++:</b> If you're looking for a language that can pretty much do anything and still hold and record for
    high performance, then C++ is your language. Although this language can be pretty difficult for newbie developers,
  it is a very good choice for general development.</p>

    <p><b>2. Kotlin:</b> This is another mind blowing language developed by google in an attempt to replace Java in
    <i>Android</i> development, so if you are trying to become an Android developer, then kotlin is for you, one of my 
  all time favourites finding its way into my top 2</p>
    
      <p><b>1. Python:</b> Python is the language you should learn today, python can be used for pratically anything, 
      Mobile development, Desktop development, Data Science, Robotics, Machine Learning, Web Development, name it
    python can do it. Another thing to note is that Python is a choice language for newbie developers who are meaning
  to start programming from the get-go. learn python today, visit <button class="btn btn-link" href="https://python.org">python.org</button> to get started.</p>
